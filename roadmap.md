# 🗺️ CP Roadmap — From CSES to Beast Mode

This roadmap outlines my phased journey through competitive programming, using CSES as the main grind base and expanding beyond as I go.

---

## 🔥 Phase 1: Foundation (CSES Intro + Basics)
- [x] Get familiar with I/O patterns
- [x] Use arithmetic tricks (Missing Number, Weird Algorithm)
- [ ] Understand basic loops, conditions
- [ ] Track edge cases early

---

## ⚔️ Phase 2: Classic Algorithms
- [ ] Sorting and Searching (Binary Search mastery)
- [ ] Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Two Pointer Techniques

---

## 🧠 Phase 3: Dynamic Programming (Beginner to Mid)
- [ ] 1D DP (Fibonacci, Coin Problems)
- [ ] 2D DP (Grid Paths, Subset Sums)
- [ ] Memoization vs Tabulation

---

## 🌲 Phase 4: Trees, Graphs, and Recursion
- [ ] DFS / BFS fundamentals
- [ ] Tree traversal (inorder, preorder)
- [ ] Union Find + Cycle Detection

---

## 🧮 Phase 5: Math, Bitmasking, and Number Theory
- [ ] Sieve of Eratosthenes
- [ ] GCD/LCM logic
- [ ] Binary Tricks (bit shifts, XOR, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Phase 6: Advanced CSES + CF Problems
- [ ] Try out harder problems from each CSES section
- [ ] Start solving Div 2 A/B problems on Codeforces
- [ ] Try timed contests

---

## 🧩 Bonus: CP Tools & Mindset
- Use templates for speed
- Debug fast with test cases
- Focus more on patterns than memorization
