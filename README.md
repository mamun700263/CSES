# 💻 CSES Problem Set — Mastery Journey

Welcome to my Competitive Programming (CP) grind, where I’m not just chasing Accepted — I’m chasing **mastery**.

This repo tracks my journey through the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), solving one problem at a time with **code, research, and structured notes**. Each problem is not just solved — it's dissected, documented, and understood.

---

## 🚀 Goal

- Solve all problems in the CSES Problem Set
- Understand the **why** behind every solution
- Build muscle memory for key CP patterns
- Track progress + create long-term CP documentation

## 🧠 Study Process (Daily Workflow)

```text
1. Pick a new problem
2. Solve it — or struggle and then solve it 😤
3. Write up:
   - Clean, readable code
   - Notes on logic + concepts
   - Edge case breakdown
   - Related problems + insights
4. Push to GitHub and update progress.md

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

See [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for a breakdown of my learning phases:

* ✅ Introductory Problems
* ⚔️ Sorting & Searching
* 🧠 Dynamic Programming
* 🌲 Graphs & Trees
* 🔢 Math & Number Theory
* 🚀 Advanced Patterns

---

## 📈 Track My Progress

Every solved problem and what I learned from it is logged in [`progress.md`](./progress.md).

---

## 📚 Templates

Use the starter code in [`templates/template.py`](./templates/template.py) to:

* Save time on boilerplate
* Stay consistent
* Speed up during contests

---

## 🧾 Sample Problem Folder

```
📁 problems/missing-number/
├── solution.py        ← Actual code
└── README.md          ← Summary, insights, edge cases, related concepts
```

Each problem has its **own folder** so the project stays clean and organized.

## 👀 Why This Repo Exists

This is a long-term, daily commitment to level up:

* Consistency > speed
* Understanding > brute force
* Foundation > shortcut

---

## 🤝 Want to Collaborate?
